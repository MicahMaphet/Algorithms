# Algorithms practice
This repository is a collection of algorithms I made by purely referencing articles and no code.
I made this to get better at:
1. Programming in general
2. C++
3. Algorithms
To practice programming, I write as much of the code I can in notepad to build good habits.
My goal is to write the entire algorithm, with notepad, without testing.
This is a good practice to understand algorithms in depth because I only reference articles, no code, forcing me to understand.
I choose algorithms that I have found helpfull in the past.

## Levenstein distance
Levenstein distance is the ammount of deletions, insertions, and swapps needed to make one string the same as another string.
I used this in a web bot to find the closest questions and answers in the form to the answer key.
Levenstin distance works by creating a tree of trying deleting, inserting, and swapping. It then picks the shortest path.
The path ends when one of the strings is empty.
I used this article for reference in programming.
